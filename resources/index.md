## Utility Websites
These websites offer powerful tools. 

- [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html). Search for Latex commands by handwriting symbols. The description of the command includes the package (if non-vanilla) and whether it should be used in math mode or text mode.

- [When2Meet](https://www.when2meet.com/). Find overlapping scheduling times. One person must create the poll at the provided link by choosing the dates (by default, the time windows are set from 9-5, but this may also be changed.) Once made, a link to the poll is created. Here is an [example poll](https://www.when2meet.com/?8850031-8Z6ku), where I have indiciated one person to be available on MWF from 10-12AM and TR from 1-3PM. As more people fill out the poll, the schedule on the left will change; the brightest green indicates where the overlap occurs, and the more faded sections indicate less overlap. White indicates no overlap.

## Software
These programs range from quite useful to absolutely essential, with a focus on open source or freely available software. 

- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/). LaTeX is the sine qua non in document creation and academic publications. The easiest way to use the software is to obtain one of the recommended distributions on the site, together with an editor such as [Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/). 

- [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html). A lightweight, open source document viewer for Windows that notably also supports many other document types such as `.djvu` files in addition to the standard `.pdf`. 

- [Foxit Reader](https://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf-reader/). Foxit is a proprietary company, but their document reader (as opposed to editor) is available for free. Notably, their free reader contains document signing capabilities, which Adobe's does not allow.
