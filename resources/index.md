## Utility Websites
These websites offer powerful tools. 

- [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html). Search for Latex commands by handwriting symbols. The description of the command includes the package (if non-vanilla) and whether it should be used in math mode or text mode.

- [When2Meet](https://www.when2meet.com/). Find overlapping scheduling times. One person must create the poll at the provided link by choosing the dates (by default, the time windows are set from 9-5, but this may also be changed.) Once made, a link to the poll is created. Here is an [example poll](https://www.when2meet.com/?8850031-8Z6ku), where I have indiciated one person to be available on MWF from 10-12AM and TR from 1-3PM. As more people fill out the poll, the schedule on the left will change; the brightest green indicates where the overlap occurs, and the more faded sections indicate less overlap. White indicates no overlap.
