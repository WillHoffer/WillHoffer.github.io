## Mathematical Research:
- Graduate student at the [University of California, Riverside](https://mathdept.ucr.edu/)
- Advisor: [Dr. Michel L. Lapidus](http://math.ucr.edu/~lapidus/)
- My thesis project involves using resurgent asymptotics to better understand explicit formulae in fractal & spectral geometry.


## Who am I?
I call myself an aspiring mathematician and physics enthusiast, which is just a fancy way of saying I am a graduate student interested in mathematical physics. I am enrolled in the mathematics PhD program at the University of California, Riverside.

Currently, I am very interested in the phenomenon of resurgence, and how we might better understand fractals using its tools and techniques. We can study fractals by understanding how their geometric oscillations reverberate in the ambient space around them-- what we call a fractal drum, or sometimes a fractal harp. These oscillations are realized as complex dimensions, and my current research project is to better understand the formulae that express geometric and spectral qualities of the fractal using these complex dimensions.

 I find myself humbled by the historical legacy I have stumbled into and by the great kindness and support I have been shown along the way. To pay these forward, I strive to leave the world better than I found it, bit by bit.
