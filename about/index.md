## Mathematical Research:
- Graduate student at the University of California, Riverside
- Advisor: [Dr. Michel L. Lapidus](http://math.ucr.edu/~lapidus/)
- My thesis project involves connecting resurgent asymptotics, fractal & spectral geometry, and explicit formulae.


## Who am I?
I call myself an aspiring mathematician and physics enthusiast, which is just the fancy way of saying I'm a graduate student in mathematical physics. Dynamics, geometry, and analysis— to pick three words— broadly summarize the topics I research. My current research project lies in investigating the asymptotics of some expansions and formulae arising in the study of fractal geometry and analytic number theory. I find myself humbled by the historical legacy I've stumbled into and the great kindness and support given to me along the way. To pay these forward, I strive to leave the world better than I found it, bit by bit.
