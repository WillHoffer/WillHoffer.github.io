# My Quiddity
I am an aspiring mathematician and physics enthusiast, which is the fancy way to say I'm a mathematics graduate student. Dynamics, geometry, and analysis— to pick three words— broadly summarize the topics I research. I find myself humbled by the historical legacy I've stumbled into and the great kindness and support given to me along the way. To pay these forward, I strive to leave the world better than I found it, bit by bit.
