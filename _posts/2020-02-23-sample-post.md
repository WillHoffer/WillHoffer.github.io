R Markdown
----------

These webpages are created using R Markdown documents. In particular,
the version of Markdown used– [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)– supports
$\\LaTeX$ quite nicely. The R programming language is supported out of
the box, and more functionality can be implemented as needed.

The website for RStudio and its discussion of R markdown may be found
<a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com" class="uri">http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com</a>.
I highly recommend viewing the instructional tools of [Boyan
Kostadinov](https://citytech-cuny.academia.edu/BoyanKostadinov/Teaching-Documents)
on the topic; I myself learned about R Markdown through his presentation
given at UCR on 11/08/2019.
