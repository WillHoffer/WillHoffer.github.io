## UCR Math 146B, Winter 2021, Homework 1

### Problems

See iLearn or the course notebook. 

### Computations

Here we provide a Mathematica notebook with some computations/solutions regarding the first homework assignment. You can make your own copy of the notebook to play around with the code if you have downloaded Mathematica, or you should be able to run it through Wolfram Alpha's site (follow the first link, or use the menu in the bottom right of the embedding.)
