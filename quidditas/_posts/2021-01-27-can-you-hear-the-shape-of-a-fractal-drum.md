## Can you hear the shape of a drum?

Mark Kac popularized the question in a [famous paper of the same name](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2313748?origin=JSTOR-pdf). Given all of the pure frequencies, or the spectrum of the drum, can one determine its shape? Since the problem is usually the other way around-- given the drum, what will its frequencies (i.e. its spectrum) be-- this is known as the inverse spectral problem.

Kac's paper was part of a great deal of twentieth century work in spectral geometry. We shall go back to the beginning of the century, to the work of Hermann Weyl. In 1910, Lorentz posed a question during some invited lectures at G&ouml;ttingen to an audience that included both David Hilbert and his student Hermann Weyl. Namely, Lorentz posed the conjecture that the number of high overtones, or large frequencies, between a frequency $\nu$ and a small increase $\nu+d\nu$ should be proportional to the volume of the region. If we let our region be $\Omega$ and denote by $N(\lambda)$ the number of frequencies up to $\lambda$, the conjecture can be stated in the form:

$$ N(\lambda) \sim \cfrac{|\Omega|}{2\pi}\lambda $$

<div>
Weyl would go on to prove the theorem two years later, using Hilbert's newly developed theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_equation" >integral equations</a>. 
In essence, the theorem states that you can hear the size of the drum, i.e. $|\Omega|$.

In general though, you can't fully hear the shape of a drum. As it turns out, there are drums with different shapes but the same spectra.
