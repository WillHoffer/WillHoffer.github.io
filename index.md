## My Blog, Quidditas
Quidditas is the name Iâ€™ve given to my personal blog. I write about mathematics, web design, and whatever other quiddities come to mind. [Check it out!](https://willhoffer.com/content/quidditas/)

## Footer Quotes

Lastly, you'll find amusing quotes in the footer, inspired by collections like that of [Doron Zeilberger's quote collection](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/quotes.html). Some are from professors or colleagues and others are from great people. Feel free to suggest additions to the quote book!
