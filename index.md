## Welcome to my Personal Website! 
Here, you can find information about me as well as my ever-in-progress blog. 

## Website Contents
Here is where to find specific information:

- [About](https://willhoffer.com/about/): a personal description of myself and links to my other online content.
- [CV](https://willhoffer.com/cv/): curriculum vitae/resume.
- [Talks](https://willhoffer.com/talks/): a record of presentations I've given along with available content.
- [Quidditas](https://willhoffer.com/quidditas/): the list of posts for my personal blog.


## Notice of Construction
Currently, the website is brand new and thus still under some important construction. Not all content is online, so feel free to reach out to me with any inquiries.


## What is Quidditas?
Quidditas is the name I've given to my personal blog. My main goal is to post about interesting topics, create educational material, and talk about my current research. So, its content will generally cover topics I encounter in my studies of mathematical physics, both classical results and modern happenings. 

Additionally, you can also find tutorials and references that I've written. The first post details how I create posts for the website. Future plans may include detailing how to set up such a website from scratch.

The word "quidditas" itself is Latin, with its English analog being the word quiddity. It has a rather odd definition: quidditas is the answer to the question "What is the thing?" (as can, for instance, be seen on [William Whitaker's Words](http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wordz.pl?keyword=quidditas)). In simpler terms, it specifies the essence of the topic. I chose it partly because I love the parallel to a seminar at my undergraduate institution called "What is?" and partly because the word itself has a lovely little linguistic flair to it (cf. the footer quote.)
