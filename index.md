# Welcome to my Personal Website! 
Here, you can find information about me as well as my ever-in-progress blog. 

## Notice of Construction
Currently, the website is under construction. The format, styling, and content will be updated, so stay tuned. 

## What is Quidditas?
The title of my personal blog, "quidditas" (or the word quiddity in English,) has a bit of an odd definition: it is the answer to the question, "What is the thing?" The word is meant to specify the very "what-ness" of the topic, its essence. The inspiration comes from a seminar I attended at a previous institution, aptly called "What is?" Translation to latin is my way to borrow a bit of linguistic flair (after all, a better William found fit to pen the word.)

The content covers topics I encounter in my studies of mathematical physics, in both classical results and modern happenings. From grandiose theories to the littlest of lemmas, all these topics I found worth digitizing.
