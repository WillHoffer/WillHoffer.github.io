# Welcome to my website! 
Here, you can find information about me as well as my ever-in-progress personal blog. 

# What is Quidditas?
The title of my personal blog, "quidditas" (or the word quiddity in English,) has a bit of an odd definition: it is the answer to the question, "What is the thing?" The word is meant to specify the very "what-ness" of the topic, its essence. At a previous institution, I attended a seminar, entitled "What is?", on student expositions into active topics in mathematics today. Translating to latin is my own personal spin to add a little bit of linguistic flair; I happen to love the sound of the words like quill, quibble, and quizzical. 

The content covers the topics I encounter in my studies of mathematical physics that I find worth digitizing in my own words. I aim to cover both classical results as well as more modern happenings in the spirit of a seminar.
