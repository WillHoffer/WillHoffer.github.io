# Utility Websites

These websites offer powerful tools, useful information, or are downright convenient. 

## Latex Companions

- [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html). Search for Latex commands by handwriting symbols. The description of the command includes the package (if non-vanilla) and whether it should be used in math mode or text mode.

- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is great for collaborative work on LaTeX documents. You can share with more than one person for free if you create a share link, rather than sharing directly. 

- [Quiver](https://q.uiver.app/) and [Tikzcd](https://tikzcd.yichuanshen.de/) are sites for creating mathematical (commutative) diagrams and exporting them in LaTeX code. 

- [MathPix](https://mathpix.com/) can be used to convert images/handwriting into LaTeX code. It's far from perfect, though, and personally, I find it easier/faster to type directly especially when the formulae are very specialized/precise. 

## Online Graphing

- [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator) is useful for graphing and creating geometric diagrams through elementary constructions. It also has a 3D graphing calculator. 
- [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) is simpler to use for ordinary 2D graphing and adding parameters, though Geogebra has the same features and also the geometry and 3D modes. 


## Scholarship

- [MathSciNet](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/index.html) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) are very useful for creating BibTex code for references. I tend to find the latter more useful, as it is both free/does not require university login to access and creates better short names for the references. 

- [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/) and its French counterpart [https://cnrs.hal.science/](https://cnrs.hal.science/) are exceedingly useful for finding openly available scientific articles and/or preprints.


## Organization

- [When2Meet](https://www.when2meet.com/). Find overlapping scheduling times. One person must create the poll at the provided link by choosing the dates (by default, the time windows are set from 9-5, but this may also be changed.) Once made, a link to the poll is created. Here is an [example poll](https://www.when2meet.com/?8850031-8Z6ku), where I have indiciated one person to be available on MWF from 10-12AM and TR from 1-3PM. As more people fill out the poll, the schedule on the left will change; the brightest green indicates where the overlap occurs, and the more faded sections indicate less overlap. White indicates no overlap.
