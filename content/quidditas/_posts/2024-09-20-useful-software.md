## Software
These programs range from quite useful to absolutely essential, with a focus on open source or freely available software. 

- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/). LaTeX is the sine qua non in document creation and academic publications. The easiest way to use the software is to obtain one of the recommended distributions on the site, together with an editor such as [Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/). 

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my preferred way of writing, editing, and compile LaTeX code. I also program using it as well.

## PDF Manipulation

- [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html). A lightweight, open source document viewer for Windows that notably also supports many other document types such as `.djvu` files in addition to the standard `.pdf`. 

- [Foxit Reader](https://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf-reader/). Foxit is a proprietary company, but their document reader (as opposed to editor) is available for free. Notably, their free reader contains document signing capabilities, which Adobe's does not allow.
