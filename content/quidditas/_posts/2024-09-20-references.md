## References
These materials, be they in digital or print, are useful sources of mathematics, physics, pedagogy, and other topics. This list will slowly expand as I find time to document books and references. For now, it's a bit sparse.

### Teaching

- [Apex Calculus](http://www.apexcalculus.com/). An open source calculus textbook. The `.pdf` version is free to download, and print copies may be obtained for a low cost. Many UCR calculus courses use this book.
