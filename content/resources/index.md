## Utility Websites
These websites offer powerful tools, useful information, or are downright convenient. 

- [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html). Search for Latex commands by handwriting symbols. The description of the command includes the package (if non-vanilla) and whether it should be used in math mode or text mode.

- [When2Meet](https://www.when2meet.com/). Find overlapping scheduling times. One person must create the poll at the provided link by choosing the dates (by default, the time windows are set from 9-5, but this may also be changed.) Once made, a link to the poll is created. Here is an [example poll](https://www.when2meet.com/?8850031-8Z6ku), where I have indiciated one person to be available on MWF from 10-12AM and TR from 1-3PM. As more people fill out the poll, the schedule on the left will change; the brightest green indicates where the overlap occurs, and the more faded sections indicate less overlap. White indicates no overlap.

- [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator) is useful for graphing and creating geometric diagrams through elementary constructions. It also has a 3D graphing calculator. [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) is simpler to use for ordinary 2D graphing and adding parameters, though Geogebra has the same features and also the geometry and 3D modes. 

- [Quiver](https://q.uiver.app/) and [Tikzcd](https://tikzcd.yichuanshen.de/) are sites for creating mathematical (commutative) diagrams and exporting them in LaTeX code. 

- [MathPix](https://mathpix.com/) can be used to convert images/handwriting into LaTeX code. It's far from perfect, though, and personally, I find it easier/faster to type directly especially when the formulae are very specialized/precise. 

- [MathSciNet](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/index.html) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) are very useful for creating BibTex code for references. I tend to find the latter more useful, as it is both free/does not require university login to access and creates better short names for the references. 

- [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/) and its French counterpart [https://cnrs.hal.science/](https://cnrs.hal.science/) are exceedingly useful for finding openly available scientific articles and/or preprints.

- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is great for collaborative work on LaTeX documents. You can share with more than one person for free if you create a share link, rather than sharing directly. 

## Software
These programs range from quite useful to absolutely essential, with a focus on open source or freely available software. 

- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/). LaTeX is the sine qua non in document creation and academic publications. The easiest way to use the software is to obtain one of the recommended distributions on the site, together with an editor such as [Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/). Personally, I prefer to use VSCode to edit and compile LaTeX code, as I also program using it as well.

- [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html). A lightweight, open source document viewer for Windows that notably also supports many other document types such as `.djvu` files in addition to the standard `.pdf`. 

- [Foxit Reader](https://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf-reader/). Foxit is a proprietary company, but their document reader (as opposed to editor) is available for free. Notably, their free reader contains document signing capabilities, which Adobe's does not allow.


## References
These materials, be they in digital or print, are useful sources of mathematics, physics, pedagogy, and other topics. This list will slowly expand as I find time to document books and references. For now, it's a bit sparse.

### Teaching

- [Apex Calculus](http://www.apexcalculus.com/). An open source calculus textbook. The `.pdf` version is free to download, and print copies may be obtained for a low cost. Many UCR calculus courses use this book.
