## Mathematical Research:
- Graduate Student/PhD Candidate at the [University of California, Riverside](https://mathdept.ucr.edu/)
- Advisor: [Dr. Michel L. Lapidus](http://math.ucr.edu/~lapidus/)
- My thesis project involves using resurgent asymptotics to study explicit formulae in fractal & spectral geometry, analytic number theory, and mathematical physics.

## Who am I?
I am a mathematical physicist, geometer, and analyist. I am a currently a graduate student and PhD candidate at the University of California, Riverside. I passed my oral examination in February of 2021, and I both obtained my masters degree and advanced to candidacy in the spring of 2021.

Currently, I am very interested in the phenomenon of resurgence, and how we might better understand fractals using its tools and techniques. We can study fractals by understanding how their geometric oscillations reverberate in the ambient space around them-- what we call a fractal drum, or sometimes a fractal harp. These oscillations are realized as complex dimensions, and my current research project is to better understand the formulae that express geometric and spectral qualities of the fractal using these complex dimensions.

I find myself humbled by the historical legacy I have stumbled into and by the great kindness and support I have been shown along the way. I am committed to paying this forward in my contributions to mathematics and physics, in my teaching, mentoring, and service, and in my daily life. 

## Commitment to Hospitality & Diversity  
I believe that mathematics ought to be shared with and be open to everyone, both for its own beauty and for the utility it brings to society and science. Moreover, I would want each mathematician's unique identity to be not merely welcomed, but also celebrated! I focus on an individual, because there are many ways to combinatorially mix together the different aspects of a person-- their personality, gender, race, ethnicity, home country, field of interest, and the many more things I cannot fit into a single list. Anyways, I think this has become a long way of saying that I want you to be welcome on the site here, and that I encourage you to share that same respect with others here and elsewhere. 

Have a wonderful day! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
