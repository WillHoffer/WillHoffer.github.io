# Overview
Here, I provide a digital copy of my notes from the Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics Math 242 course of Winter 2020 at UCR, taught by Dr. Lapidus.

The course began by developing classical mechanics through the Hamiltonian formulation, which then provides the essential framework to formulate the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics. 


## Hamiltonian Mechanics
We shall consider the motion of a particle on a manifold $\M$
