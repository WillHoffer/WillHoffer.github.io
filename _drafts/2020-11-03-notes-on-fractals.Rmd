Introduction
============

### Preface {#preface .unnumbered}

The following are course notes from a topics course taught by Dr. Lapidus at University of California, Riverside
during the Fall 2020 quarter. The course is entitled "Fractal Geometry, Complex Dimensions, and Zeta Functions: Geometry and Spectra of Fractal Strings."


### Work in Progress
Note that these notes are a currently a work in progress. If you would like to see photographic copies of my notes from the course, they are available via [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P6DR6_KdUUM_mmMGHNQjMY3Yybhb73D9/view?usp=sharing).
